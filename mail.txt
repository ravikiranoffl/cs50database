Dear Registrant, 

This is CS50 Cloud Support Team, Here by giving clearity of frozen state of registration of CS50P Trimester 2025 
Under Educator Quota, we had already informed to get enrolled and create CS50 workspace id without fail by this 
friday. Registrant is also requested to contact your respective educator but we got no response from educator 
regarding your contact details and hence educator mentioned your registration into frozen state which is considered
as the inactive and unprogressive status, Hence according to the CS50P Trimester Terms and Conditions, Page iv, If 
any student or registrant is considered or found inactive or unprogressive and even didnt respond on various contact 
status thus they are frozen and further lead to detanation of course and they are discarded from course without any 
intimation or warning, so having impact of educator we gave another golden oppurtunity to register back and create id 
and continue in the course without hurdles or problems.

Utilise the chance and register back into the course without any fail and hurdles. In next 12 Hours report us back 
regarding your registration and id , workspace creation, your detailed are then esclated to change the state from 
frozen to progressive.

Your, 
CS50 Cloud Team
