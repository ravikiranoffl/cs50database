## 🎯 The Core Idea: OS Is a Resource Manager

Imagine your computer as a big office:

| Element        | In Real Life          | In Computer Terms   |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Office Manager | Operating System (OS) | Controls everything |
| Employees      | Apps (Chrome, etc.)   | Request resources   |
| Resources      | RAM, CPU, I/O         | Managed by OS       |

Every time you open Chrome, here's what happens:

1. OS creates a **process** for Chrome.
2. Chrome asks for RAM → OS allocates it.
3. Chrome makes **system calls** to read files, show web pages.
4. You type → Keyboard sends an **interrupt** → OS reads input.
5. Chrome wants to download a file → OS talks to disk/network.

## 🖥️ What Is an Operating System?

> **An OS is the software layer that sits between applications and hardware**, managing resources and enabling interaction with the system safely and efficiently.

## ⚙️ Functions of the OS

| Role                 | What It Does                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Process Manager**  | Manages running programs (apps)       |
| **Memory Manager**   | Allocates RAM to programs             |
| **File Manager**     | Reads/writes from storage devices     |
| **Device Manager**   | Handles I/O: keyboard, mouse, printer |
| **Security Manager** | Controls permissions and isolation    |

---

## 🧠 System Calls (a.k.a Monitor Calls)

Applications **can't touch hardware directly**.

Instead, they use **system calls** to ask the OS for services:

```c
open("file.txt")   // Asks OS to open a file
```

The OS handles the request _securely_ and talks to the disk for you.

---

## ⚡ Interrupts

Interrupts are **signals from hardware** to the OS.

Example:

- You press a key → Keyboard sends **interrupt**
- OS **pauses current task**, reads the key, continues

This is how real-time response happens!

## 🔁 Boot Process: The Bootstrap Program

When you press power:

1. **BIOS/UEFI** runs from firmware
2. It loads a tiny **bootstrap loader**
3. The loader loads the **OS kernel** into memory
4. OS takes over system control

## 🧩 OS vs Kernel vs Shell

| Term       | What It Is                                    |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Kernel** | Core of OS: manages memory, CPU, system calls |
| **OS**     | Kernel + shell + tools (like Ubuntu, Windows) |
| **Shell**  | Interface (CLI or GUI) for users              |

---

## 🤖 Is Windows/Linux/Android an OS or a Kernel?

| System      | OS or Kernel?    | Notes                               |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Linux**   | Kernel           | Not a full OS by itself             |
| **Ubuntu**  | OS (Linux-based) | Linux kernel + UI + tools           |
| **Windows** | Full OS          | Own kernel and environment          |
| **Android** | OS (Linux-based) | Custom mobile OS using Linux kernel |

## 🧪 Try This (Ubuntu WSL)

Launch your Ubuntu terminal and try:

```bash
uname -a       # See kernel info
ps -ef         # List all processes
top            # Live system monitor
ls /           # Show root directory
whoami         # Show current user
```

## 📚 Summary: Your First Mental Model

> "The Operating System is the **manager** of everything inside your computer."

- Apps make **system calls** to request services
- OS handles hardware via **device drivers**
- Keyboard/mouse communicate via **interrupts**
- Everything starts with a **bootstrap loader**
- Linux is a **kernel**, Ubuntu is a **full OS**
